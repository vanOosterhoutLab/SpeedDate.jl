# SpeedDate.jl

A simple tool for the estimation of coalescence times between sequences.
Created with julia and [Bio.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/Bio.jl)

[Documentation](https://ward9250.github.io/SpeedDate.jl/latest)

_A note about unit tests, as SpeedDate essentially wraps Bio.jl functionality in a command line or GTK gui, no unit tests have been included yet, as the functions used have their own unit tests in the BioJulia project in which they are defined._
